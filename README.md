# Introduction to Linux

_Please note: The materials in this repo are mainly in Finnish as it was the language of instruction on this course. However, there are screenshots within the text for clarification._

This repo is the assignment submission archive for the Introduction to Linux course I completed at Laurea University of Applied Sciences.

On this course, we learned to use Linux in a virtual machine using a prepackaged disk image in VirtualBox. The course materials covered the basics of using Linux: 

- How to use with the Linux terminal (`bash`) for basic operations such as setting read/write and execute permissions on files (`chmod`)
- How to install and remove programs as well as update the system using the `apt` package manager (`sudo apt install/remove`, `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`)
- How to create and delete folders recursively (the `*` operator)

In addition to this, we learned to schedule functions using `cron', to improve system security, e.g. with the help of a firewall. We also learned how to use the Linux Mint graphical user interface in the Cinnamon desktop environment (DE).
